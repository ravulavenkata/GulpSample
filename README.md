# GulpSample

The first you need to do is to download and install Node.js. 
You also need to download and install Git.  
Bower requies Node.js, Node package manager (NPM) and Git.

When Node.js and Git is installed you can start Visual Studio and open this project

You can use Node Package Manager in your project to install Bower and Gulp.

If everything works fine you should now be able to Build and get Bower and Gulp dowloaded to a "node_modules" folder and Bower and Gulp will be installed. The first time you build your project it will take a while becuase of the downloading of the packges and the installing of Bower and Gulp. But next time your Build  the project, it will build much faster.
